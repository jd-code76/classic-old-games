			<h2>Brief History of Lord of the Rings: The Third Age</h2>
			<p>
			Originally released on November 2nd, 2004 by EA Games, The Third Age is a turn-based role-playing game developed by EA Redwood Shores. Unlike the previous action games, The Third Age uses a traditional JRPG-style combat system, taking heavy inspiration from Final Fantasy X.
			</p>
			<p>
			The game follows a new party of characters who travel parallel to the Fellowship's journey, experiencing events from the films from a different perspective. The combat system featured a "Perfect Mode" mechanic that rewarded well-timed attacks and defenses.
			</p>
			<p>
			The Third Age received mixed reviews, with praise for its graphics and presentation but criticism for its derivative gameplay and lack of innovation. Despite this, it developed a cult following among RPG enthusiasts and Lord of the Rings fans alike. To this day, it remains one of the more unique movie tie-in games ever released.
			</p>
			<p>
			Once again, a GameBoy Advance version of the game was released on the same day as the console versions, again being developed by Griptonite Games. This version of the game attempted to emulate the Fire Emblem games with a top down view of the battlefield but includes a unique "flank" mechanic, where the player must battle across three separate lanes (flanks in the game). In each flank, he gains command points based on his chosen commander/heroes that he can then use to attack enemy units.
			</p>
			<p>
			The game remains one of the most unique GBA tactics games for its mechanics and allows for the player to choose from one of three good or three evil comander units. The player can play one good and evil game at the same time, with the game allowing for manual saves after each of the 24 levels. The game also contains bonus levels based on various criteria, like beating the game on Sauron (perma-death) mode.
