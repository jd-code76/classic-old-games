			<h2>Brief History of Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King</h2>
			<p>
			Originally released on November 6th, 2003 by EA Games, The Return of the King is the sequel to The Two Towers game, developed by EA Redwood Shores. The game covers the events of the third film and expands on the gameplay of its predecessor.
			</p>
			<p>
			The game introduced new playable characters including Gandalf, Samwise, and Frodo, with each character having unique abilities and story paths. It featured cooperative multiplayer, allowing two players to fight together through the campaign.
			</p>
			<p>
			The Return of the King was critically acclaimed, winning several awards including "Best Adaptation" at the 2004 Game Developers Choice Awards. It sold over 5 million copies and is considered one of the best movie-licensed games ever made.
			</p>
			<p>
			Like The Two Towers before it, a GameBoy Advance version of the game was released on November 12th, 2002, also developed by Griptonite Games. It was released on the same day as the console version and took on the same isometrioc view as The Two Towers.
			</p>
			<p>
			However, Griptonite improved on that game wih Return of the King, allowing the player to even swap gear between theior characters. The game was well received and is considered one of the best GBA games ever released.
