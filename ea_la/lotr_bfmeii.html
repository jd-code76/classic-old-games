			<h2>Brief History of Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II</h2>
			<p>
			Originally released on February 28th, 2006 by EA Games, The Battle for Middle-earth II is the sequel to the original BFME game, developed by EA Los Angeles. The game expands on the original with new factions, units, and an improved game engine.
			</p>
			<p>
			The game introduced two new factions: the Elves and the Dwarves, bringing the total to six playable races. It featured a new campaign that explored events in the northern regions of Middle-earth during the War of the Ring.
			</p>
			<p>
			BFME II was praised for its improved graphics, expanded faction roster, and deeper strategic gameplay. It received positive reviews and maintained an active multiplayer community for years after release. The game also received an expansion pack, "Rise of the Witch King," which added the Angmar faction.
