			<h2>Brief History of Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth</h2>
			<p>
			Originally released on December 6th, 2004 by EA Games, The Battle for Middle-earth is a real-time strategy game developed by EA Los Angeles. It was built using the SAGE engine, which was also used for Command & Conquer: Generals. The game features four factions: Gondor, Rohan, Isengard, and Mordor, each with unique units, heroes, and abilities. The campaign follows the events of the film trilogy, allowing players to experience major battles from both good and evil perspectives.
			</p>
			<p>
			However, it was also notorious for its crazy development schedule and awful working conditions. The crunch was so bad that many developers had to spend upwards of 60-80+ hours per week working on the game without sleep. This prompted a multi-million dollar lawsuit that eventually ended in EA settling for nearly $15 million.
			</p>
			<p>
			In spite of the horrible working conditions, the game was a critical and commercial success, being praised for its faithful adaptation of the source material, impressive visuals and solid RTS gameplay. It sold over 2 million copies, leading to the development of a sequel and expansion pack.
