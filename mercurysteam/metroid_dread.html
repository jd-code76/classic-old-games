			<h2>Brief History of Metroid Dread</h2>
			<p>
			Originally released on October 8, 2021, for the Nintendo Switch, Metroid Dread (Metroid 5 in the main series) is a 2D action-adventure game developed by MercurySteam and Nintendo. It is critically acclaimed for reviving the 2D Metroid series after a 19-year gap, delivering polished gameplay, stunning visuals, and a gripping atmosphere. Its status as a modern classic comes from its successful blend of classic Metroidvania exploration with new mechanics like stealth-based E.M.M.I. encounters, aeion abilities, complex bosses, and tighter controls.
			</p>
			<p>
			Gameplay focuses on exploration in a non-linear, interconnected world, with Samus Aran navigating the planet ZDR. Players acquire abilities like missiles, morph ball, and the grapple beam, which unlock new areas in true Metroidvania fashion. The E.M.M.I. mechanic adds tension, requiring stealth or evasion in designated zones, offering a complete change of pace from the other areas of the game. Combat is fast-paced, with precise platforming and shooting mechanics, including an improved counter mechanic that was introduced in MercurySteam's first Metroid title, Samus Returns.
