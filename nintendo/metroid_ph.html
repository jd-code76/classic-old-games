			<h2>Brief History of Metroid Prime Hunters</h2>
			<p>
			Originally released on March 20, 2006, for the Nintendo DS, Metroid Prime Hunters is a first-person action-adventure game developed by Nintendo Software Technology. It is acclaimed for its innovative use of the DS’s touchscreen controls and robust multiplayer mode, which brought competitive Metroid gameplay to a portable platform.
			</p>
			<p>
			Gameplay is very similar to the main Prime series, following Samus Aran and other bounty hunters in the Alimbic Cluster. Players acquire abilities like the morph ball and affinity weapons (different types of beams) required for navigating the various environments. The touchscreen controls enable precise aiming, while multiplayer supports up to four players with customizable loadouts, including offline play with AI controlled bots. The single-player experience retains some of Metroid’s non-linear style, but is often viewed as repetitive and lacking. However, the multiplayer focus and introduction of rival hunters make it a distinct entry in the series.
