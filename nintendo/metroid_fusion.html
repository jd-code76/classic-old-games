			<h2>Brief History of Metroid Fusion</h2>
			<p>
			Originally released on November 17, 2002, for the Game Boy Advance, the same day as Metroid Prime for the GameCube, Metroid Fusion (Metroid 4) is part of the main series of Metroid games. It is highly regarded for its atmospheric tension and polished gameplay, standing out as a more linear yet gripping entry in the Metroid series. It offers a unique approach to storytelling in the Metroid series, providing a the player with lots of exposition about Samus and her experience with the X parasite. The game's refined mechanics and streamlined controls appealed to fans of the Metroidvania genre
			</p>
			<p>
			Like other 2D Metroid games, Fusion follows Samus Aran while she investigates a research station. Areas of the game follow a linear structure with the typical Metroidvania elements sprinkled in as the player unlocks new abilities. Some of these  abilities include diffusion missiles and the screw attack, which are of course necessary for unlocking new areas. The SA-X, a parasitic doppelgänger, is a unique enemy that adds suspense, requiring stealth in certain sections. Generally though, combat is fast-paced, with tight platforming and shooting mechanics. The game’s vibrant visuals and strong narrative focus make it a memorable entry in the series.
