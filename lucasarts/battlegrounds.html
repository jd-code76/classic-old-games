			<h2>Brief History of Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds</h2>
			<p>
			Originally released on November 9th, 2001 for Windows, Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds is an RTS built on the same engine that powers Age of Empires II, Genie. Battlegrounds plays like a traditional RTS with base building, unit creation, and real time tactics being key features.
			</p>
			<p>
			The game includes five campaigns in addition to a tutorial campaign. These campaigns allow the player to control the following factions: Galactic Empire, Rebel Alliance, Trade Federation, Wookies, and Gungans. Each faction has unique units that each have their own strengths and weaknesses.
			</p>
			<p>
			An expansion titled "Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds: Clone Campaigns" was released on May 14th, 2002. The expansion contains two additional factions: Republic and Confederacy.
