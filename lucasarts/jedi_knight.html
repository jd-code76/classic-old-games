			<h2>Brief History of Star Wars Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II</h2>
			<p>
			Originally released on October 10th, 1997 for Windows, Star Wars Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II continues the story of Kyle Katarn and his partner Jan Ors. The general plot is that Kyle must learn to use the force and become a Jedi in order to locate the Valley of the Jedi and stop the Dark Jedi Jerec. Also of note is that this is the first game to use the Jedi Knight subtitle, making it the first Jedi Knight game in the series. The story of the game has two endings based on the player's actions throughout the course of the game.
			</p>
			<p>
			Jedi Knight uses FMV and CGI for its cutscenes instead of the classic hand drawn adventure game style cutscenes of the first game. Additionally, the new Sith engine allows for full 3D gameplay and objects, making the game much more immersive than the first. Major upgrades and additions include allowing the player to use a lightsaber and force powers as well as allowing the player to switch between first and third person perspectives.
			</p>
			<p>
			Jedi Knight also includes multiplayer capabilities and garnered a large following of players. With fast-paced gameplay similar to Quake and tremendous modding capability, Dark Forces II remains one of the most fun and unique Star Wars games to this day.
