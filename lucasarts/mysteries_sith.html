			<h2>Brief History of Star Wars Jedi Knight: Mysteries of the Sith</h2>
			<p>
			Originally released on January 31st, 1998 for Windows, Star Wars Jedi Knight: Mysteries of the Sith is an expansion for Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II. The first few missions of the games 14 level campaign focus on Kyle Katarn and his new role as a Jedi Master. After some plot twists, the game shifts to focus on Mara Jade, a newly trained Jedi Knight and Kyle's disciple.

			<p>
			Mysteries of the Sith contains several technical improvements over Jedi Knight's version of the Sith engine. These changes include colored lighting, better models and textures, improved AI, and other minor changes.
			</p>
			<p>
			Like Jedi Knight, Mysteries of the Sith contains a multiplayer mode that supports up to 8 players. In contrast to Jedi Knight's level design, Mysteries of the Sith focuses more on puzzles and exploration, ultimately making for a more challenging experience than Jedi Knight.
