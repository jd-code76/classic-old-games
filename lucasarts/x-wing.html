			<h2>Brief History of Star Wars: X-Wing</h2>
			<p>
			Originally released in February, 1995 for MS-DOS, Star Wars: X-Wing is a flight simulation game and the first entry in the X-Wing series. X-Wing allows the player to engage in popular dogfights from the Original Trilogy, requiring the player to complete a variety of missions across three tours of duty.
			</p>
			<p>
			X-Wing received an upgraded version of the game in 1994 released as a collector's CD-ROM. This version ported the game to the newer TIE Fighter game engine, which supports improved shading and rendering techniques. Another version of the game was released in 1998, this time using the X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter engine. This version includes support for 3D hardware acceleration and better texture mapping. Some other minor changes to the graphics were also included as part of this version.
			</p>
			<p>
			Two expansions packs were released for X-Wing: "Imperial Pursuit" and "B-Wing". The expansions and all other content are part of the Special Edition that is available on GOG and Steam, including the DOS and collector's CD-ROM versions of the game as well as additional content not found in other releases.
