			<h2>Brief History of Star Wars: TIE Fighter</h2>
			<p>
			Originally released in July, 1994 for MS-DOS, Star Wars: TIE Fighter is a flight simulation game and the sequel to X-Wing. TIE Fighter improved on the mission and gameplay designs of X-Wing and is considered to be one of the best games ever made.
			</p>
			<p>
			Like X-Wing, TIE Fighter received an upgraded version of the game in 1995 released as a collector's CD-ROM. This version included better graphics, support for higher resolutions, and enhanced cutscenes. Also like X-Wing, another version of the game was released in 1998, using the X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter engine. This version includes support for 3D hardware acceleration and better texture mapping. Some other minor changes to the graphics were also included as part of this version.
			</p>
			<p>
			A Special Edition of the game was also released on GOG and Steam. It includes the DOS and collector's CD-ROM versions of the game in addition to all of the content from previous releases, including the two expansions, "Defenders of the Empire" and "Enemies of the Empire".
