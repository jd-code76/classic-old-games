			<h2>Brief History of Star Wars: Dark Forces</h2>
			<p>
			Originally released on February 28th, 1995 for MS-DOS, Star Wars: Dark Forces is an early FPS set in the Star Wars Expanded Universe. With Dark Forces, LucasArts took their experience in adventure games and applied it to the Dark Forces project with very creative cutscenes and character development, creating one of the most iconic characters of the EU known as Kyle Katarn.
			</p>
			<p>
			The Dark Forces engine, known as Jedi, allows the player to jump, crouch, and look up/down. The game also had many items that the player could use (head lamps, ice cleats, and air masks) in order to traverse certain areas. In addition, the game placed heavy emphasis on puzzle solving and objective completion.			
			</p>
			<p>
			Dark Forces went on to receive good sales and a dedicated fanbase. The game also led to the eventual creation of the Jedi Knight series, one of the best series of Star Wars games ever made. Unfortunately, the game does not support multiplayer functionality which was one of the main criticisms of its original release.
