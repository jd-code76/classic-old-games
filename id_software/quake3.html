			<h2>Brief History of Quake III: Arena</h2>
			<p>
			Originally released on December 2nd, 1999 for Windows, Quake III was a game with a lot of "firsts." It was the first game in the series to not have a single-player campaign, featuring online and local multiplayer gameplay (although AI bots are supported). It was the first game in the series to require a discrete graphics card which was largely unheard of at the time. It was the first game to utilize the id Tech 3 engine (the same engine that lives on in Call of Duty and other FPS games).
			</p>
			<p>
			Quake III was revolutionary for the FPS genre much in the same way that the original Quake was. The multiplayer in Quake III was known for being the most refined version of Quake at the time and to this day, people still play it. Quake III also significantly increased the presence of competitive gamers and eSports teams, with large tournaments being held annually. An expansion pack titled "Team Arena" was released by id on December 18th, 2000. Team Arena focuses on team oriented multiplayer modes and contains a single-player mode as well as bots.
