			<h2>Brief History of Wolfenstein 3D</h2>
			<p>
			Released on May 5th, 1992, Wolfenstein 3D is the game that effectively created the first-person shooter (FPS) genre. If Doom is considered to be the father of the FPS genre, Wolf 3D is the grandfather, the game that showed the true capability of computer gaming. Wolf 3D has relatively simple (although maze-like) level design, three guns, and a fairly simple gameplay loop. The game is broken into two parts, containing a total of six episodes.
			</p>
			<p>
			The original release of Wolf 3D only contained three episodes (1-3), however, id eventually ended up making a second trilogy of episodes at the request of Scott Miller (Apogee Software founder). The second trilogy (episodes 4-6) acts as a prequel to episodes 1-3 and are known as the "Nocturnal Missions". The episodes are named as follows: 
				<ol>
				<li>"Escape from Castle Wolfenstein"</li>
				<li>"Operation Eisenfaust"</li>
				<li>"Die, Fuhrer, Die!"</li>
				<li>"Dark Secret"</li>
				<li>"Trail of the Madman"</li>
				<li>"Confrontation"</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
			<p>
			A prequel game titled "Spear of Destiny" was released on September 18th, 1992. It uses the same engine as Wolf 3D, making minor improvements while also adding it's own new textures, music, enemies, and more. In total, the game has 21 levels (a boss level and two secret levels are included as well). Two mission packs were released for the game entitled "Mission 2: Return to Danger" and "Mission 3: Ultimate Challenge", but these packs received largely negative reviews.
			</p>
			<p>
			Wolfenstein 3D was originally going to have stealth mechanics since the game was planned to be a spiritual successor to the games "Castle Wolfenstein" and "Beyond Castle Wolfenstein". The stealth mechanics ended up being cut when id decide that the features slowed the game down too much. Hidden secrets throughout the levels were suggested by Tom Hall as a way to help break up the constant action, a feature that carried it's way into Doom, Quake, and many other 90s shooters.
			</p>
			<p>
			Wolf 3D garnered a fair share of controversy due to its use of Nazi imagery and the ability to kill dogs in the game (German shepherds). Despite this, Wolf 3D was a significant success for id, eclipsing their earlier Commander Keen titles in both sales and general popularity.
