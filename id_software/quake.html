			<h2>Brief History of Quake</h2>
			<p>
			Originally released on June 22nd, 1996 for Windows, Quake was the first true 3D game released from id Software. Building off the success of Doom, id further refined the FPS genre with Quake's fast-paced gameplay and (at the time) realistic looking 3D environments. Online multiplayer became a huge part of the Quake community that to this day has a small but dedicated community of modders, map makers, and players.
			</p>
			<p>
			The game starts by putting the player in a hub where he must select the difficulty by walking into the appropriate teleporter (there is also a hidden fourth difficulty settings known as "Nightmare"). After difficulty selection, the player may choose from one of four other teleporters, each with their own theme. Each of these teleporters represents one episode of the game:
				<ol>
				<li>"Dimension of the Doomed"</li>
				<li>"The Realm of Black Magic"</li>
				<li>"The Netherworld"</li>
				<li>"The Elder World"</li>
				</ol>
			Two mission packs were also released for Quake. The first, "Scourge of Armagon" was released on March 5th, 1997. This expansion contains three episodes:
				<ol>
				<li>"Fortress of the Dead"</li>
				<li>"Dominion of Darkness"</li>
				<li>"The Rift"</li>
				</ol>
			The second, "Dissolution of Eternity" was released on March 19, 1997. This expansion contains two episodes:
				<ol>
				<li>"Hell's Fortress"</li>
				<li>"The Corridors of Time"</li>
				</ol>
			A third mission pack "Dimension of the Past" was developed by MachineGames and released on June 24th, 2016 to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Quake.
			</p>
			<p>
			Quake is well known for it's user-generated content like the popular Team Fortress mod. Some players even used the game's replay functionality and recording tools to create early machinima films. Maps and mods continue to be made today, 25 years after the game's original release. In addition, the Quake engine (id Tech 2) was used to create other games, even as recently as 2021's Wrath: Aeon of Ruin by 3D Realms.
