			<h2>Brief History of Final Doom</h2>
			<p>
			Originally released on June 17th, 1996 for MS-DOS, Final Doom was the collaborative effort of TeamTNT, creating two 32-level megaWADs based on the Doom II version of idTech 1. These megaWADs effectively acted as two expansions for Doom II, with each one following it's own storyline. The two megaWADs are "TNT: Evilution" and "The Plutonia Experiment".
			</p>
			<p>
			Both megaWADs are infamous for their difficulty and creative level design. Plutonia in particular was known for being one of the most difficult WADs to beat on Nightmare difficulty, with the first known record of a complete Nightmare run <a href="https://invidious.silkky.cloud/watch?v=EUBUYWIZUpE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">uploaded on June 7th, 2015</a>, almost 20 years after Final Doom's release.
			</p>
			<p>
			An updated version of the game titled "DOOM + DOOM II" was released on August 8th, 2024. This version, if you have a Bethesda.net account, allows you to download mods directly from the site, even on consoles.
