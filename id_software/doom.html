			<h2>Brief History of Doom</h2>
			<p>
			Originally released on December 10th, 1993 for MS-DOS, Doom is considered to be the father of the FPS genre. The game is comprised of 3 episodes (27 levels) that are named as follows:
				<ol>
				<li>"Knee-deep in the Dead"</li>
				<li>"The Shores of Hell"</li>
				<li>"Inferno"</li>
				</ol>
			In 1995, id Software released Ultimate Doom which includes the original 3 episodes plus a brand new one entitled "Thy Flesh Consumed", bringing the total number of levels up to 36.
			</p>
			<p>
			Improving on the formula that Wolfenstein 3D created, Doom added more complex level design and many more weapons. Doom also added a multiplayer component that is considered to be the genesis of the term "deathmatch" as it is known today. The shareware version of Doom contains the 1st episode of the game and has been downloaded an estimated 20 million times, at one point being installed on more computers than Windows.
			</p>
			<p>
			An updated version of the game titled "DOOM + DOOM II" was released on August 8th, 2024. This version, if you have a Bethesda.net account, allows you to download mods directly from the site, even on consoles.
