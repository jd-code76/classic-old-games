			<h2>Brief History of Quake II</h2>
			<p>
			Originally released on December 9th, 1997 for Windows, Quake II took the formula of Quake to the next level. However, it is worth noting that Quake II is a sequel in name only since id felt like the fast-paced gameplay was similar enough to Quake that they ended up not creating a new franchise. Like every new id game, Quake II includes improved graphics, new weapons, new power ups, and an expansive multiplayer. Unlike id's other games, however, Quake II put a lot more focus on the story and creating an immersive world.

			<p>
			Two mission packs were also released for Quake II. The first, "The Reckoning" was developed by Xatrix Entertainment and released on May 31, 1998. The second, "Ground Zero" was developed by Rogue Entertainment and released on September 11, 1998.
