			<h2>Brief History of Doom 3</h2>
			<p>
			Originally released on August 3rd, 2004 for Windows, Doom 3 was a highly anticipated "sequel" to classic Doom. The game ended up being a reboot of the classic games with a major focus on survival horror elements and story as opposed to fast-paced demon slaying action. While this disappointed some fans, the game is very good in it's own right having very good sound design and fantastic graphics at the time. Most games at the time were very polygonal and unrealistic looking, but Doom 3 brought life-like animation and, most importantly, highly detailed lighting to the mainstream market.
			</p>
			<p>
			Being the first game to utilize the id Tech 4 engine, Doom 3 set a new standard for computer graphics, using techniques that modern games still use to this day. Doom 3 also received an expansion titled "Resurrection of Evil" that added new weapons, demons, multiplayer modes, and other features. The expansion was developed by Nerve Software and released on October 5th, 2005. A movie loosely based on the Doom universe was released around the same time in 2005 as well.
