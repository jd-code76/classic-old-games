			<h2>Brief History of Quake Live</h2>
			<p>
			Originally released on August 6th, 2010 for Windows, Quake Live is a multiplayer only title that is based on Quake III. It was originally designed to be played in a web browser using a special plugin, meaning that the game itself did not need to be downloaded. The idea was to create a free-to-play Quake III with pre-paid advertisements. Unfortunately, this approach was not profitable, so id created a subscription model for the game.
			</p>
			<p>
			Today, the game is available on Steam as a $10 download with no subscription or additional fees necessary to play the game. It still has a dedicated community and includes Steam Workshop support for maps and mods.
