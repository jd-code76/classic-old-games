			<h2>Brief History of Star Wars: Empire at War</h2>
			<p>
			Originally released on February 16, 2006, by LucasArts and developed by Petroglyph Games, Star Wars: Empire at War is a real-time strategy (RTS) game set in the Star Wars universe. It allows players to control either the Galactic Empire or the Rebel Alliance, engaging in both ground and space battles across iconic locations from the original Star Wars trilogy.
			</p>
			<p>
			The game was praised for its innovative combination of tactical space combat and ground-based warfare, offering players the ability to manage large-scale campaigns. It also introduced a "Galactic Conquest" mode, where players could strategize and conquer planets to dominate the galaxy. An expansion pack, "Forces of Corruption," was released later in 2006, adding a third faction, the Zann Consortium, along with new units and story content.
			</p>
			<p>
			In 2023, Petroglyph released an updat for the Steam version fo the game, "Star Wars: Empire at War: Gold Edition", that added 64-bit support, allowing for more complex mods like Thrawn's Revenge and fixing long-standing out of memoery issues. However, one important note is that 32-bit saves are not compatible with the 64-bit version of the game. The Steam release also includes Workshop support, allowing users to easily install a variety of mods and other fixes. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Star Wars: Empire at War remains a beloved title among Star Wars fans and RTS enthusiasts due to its deep strategy mechanics and faithful representation of the Star Wars universe. The game has seen a resurgence in popularity thanks to active modding communities that add new content, factions, and graphical enhancements.
