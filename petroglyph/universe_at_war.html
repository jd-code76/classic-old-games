			<h2>Brief History of Universe at War: Earth Assault</h2>
			<p>
			Originally released on December 10th, 2007 for PC, Universe at War: Earth Assault is a real-time strategy game developed by Petroglyph set in a near-future Earth invaded by three alien factions. The game features a unique asymmetric design where each faction operates with completely different mechanics, units, and strategies.
			</p>
			<p>
			The three playable factions include: The Hierarchy (brutal alien invaders with massive walkers), The Novus (a robotic faction focused on speed and technology), and The Masari (an ancient humanoid race with advanced energy-based technology). Each faction offers distinct playstyles, from the Hierarchy's massive walker-based warfare to Novus' network-based mobility and the Masari's ability to shift between light and dark modes.
			</p>
			<p>
			Despite receiving positive reviews for its innovative faction design and large-scale battles, Universe at War struggled commercially. The game's development was impacted by the collapse of publisher SEGA's PC division, leading to limited marketing support. However, it developed a dedicated cult following for its deep strategic gameplay and unique faction mechanics that remain distinctive in the RTS genre.
