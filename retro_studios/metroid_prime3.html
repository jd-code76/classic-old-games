        <h2>Brief History of Metroid Prime 3: Corruption</h2>
        <p>
        Originally released on August 27th, 2007, for the Nintendo Wii, Metroid Prime 3: Corruption is the third and final installment in the Prime trilogy. Developed by Retro Studios for the Wii, it introduced revolutionary motion controls using the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, allowing players to aim and fire weapons with unprecedented precision. The game was praised for its immersive first-person experience and innovative control scheme.
        </p>
        <p>
        Set six months after Metroid Prime 2: Echoes, the story follows Samus Aran as she joins forces with the Galactic Federation to combat Dark Samus and the Space Pirates, who are attempting to corrupt the galaxy using Phazon. A key new feature is Hypermode, which allows Samus to unleash devastating attacks at the cost of gradually corrupting her with Phazon. Players can also command Samus' gunship for the first time in the series.
        </p>
        <p>
        The game takes place across multiple planets including Norion, Bryyo, and Elysia, each with unique environments and challenges. Metroid Prime 3 concludes the Phazon storyline and was later included in the Metroid Prime Trilogy compilation, which added the motion controls to the first two games. It received critical acclaim for its controls, graphics, and storytelling.
