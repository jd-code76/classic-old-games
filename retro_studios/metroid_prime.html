        <h2>Brief History of Metroid Prime</h2>
        <p>
        Originally released on November 17th, 2002, for the Nintendo GameCube, the same day as Metroid Fusion for the GBA, Metroid Prime is a first-person action-adventure game developed by Retro Studios with oversight from Nintendo. It is the first in the Prime sub-series of Metroid games and is often considered one of the greatest games of all time. It is especially renowned for successfully transitioning the Metroid series into 3D while retaining its exploration-driven roots. It has earned universal acclaim for its immersive world, detailed environments, and innovative mechanics like the visor system.
        </p>

        Gameplay involves Samus Aran exploring the planet Tallon IV, acquiring abilities like the morph ball, space jump, and beam weapons to unlock new areas. The first-person perspective enhances immersion, with scanning mechanics providing lore and clues. Further attention to detail, like water drops forming on Samus' visor or her breathe fogging up the inside of it make for a much more intimate experience.
        </p>
        <p>
        Combat blends shooting and platforming, with a lock-on targeting system (similar to Zelda: Ocarina of Time) and varied enemies requiring the player to switch beams in order to defeat them. The game’s atmospheric design, backed by a memorable soundtrack, creates a sense of discovery, making it a pinnacle of the Metroid series. It would later be released as part of the Prime Trilogy on the Wii with added motion controls and given a proper remaster for the Switch.
