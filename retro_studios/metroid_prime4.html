        <h2>Brief History of Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</h2>
        <p>
        Originally released on December 4th, 2025, for both Nintendo Switch and the Nintendo Switch 2, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond marks the long-awaited return of the Prime series after an 18-year gap following Metroid Prime 3: Corruption. The game was developed by Retro Studios after Nintendo restarted development in 2019, moving it from Bandai Namco Studios to ensure quality matched the series' high standards.

        <p>
        Gameplay involves Samus Aran being transported to the mysterious planet Viewros after a Galactic Federation research center is attacked. She must explore this ancient alien world while confronting her rival bounty hunter Sylux, who holds a deep grudge against both Samus and the Galactic Federation. The game introduces new psychic abilities that allow players to control beam shots and manipulate objects, useful in both combat and puzzle-solving.

        The first-person perspective retains the series' signature exploration and scanning mechanics, while new elements like the Vi-0-La motorcycle provide fast traversal across the game's hub world, Sol Valley. The Switch 2 version offers enhanced visuals with Quality Mode (4K/60fps) or Performance Mode (1080p/120fps), along with optional mouse controls via Joy-Con 2 controllers for precise aiming. The game received generally positive reviews for its environmental design and overall gameplay while maintaining the core Metroid Prime experience, with criticism directed at the bland hub world, annoying NPC dialogue, and the end-game green crystal grind.
