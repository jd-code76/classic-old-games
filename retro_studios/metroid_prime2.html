        <h2>Brief History of Metroid Prime 2: Echoes</h2>
        <p>
        Originally released on November 15th, 2004, for the Nintendo GameCube, Metroid Prime 2: Echoes is the sequel to Metroid Prime, developed by Retro Studios. It is acclaimed for expanding the 3D Metroid formula with an innovative light/dark world mechanic, challenging puzzles, and a multiplayer mode, earning praise for its ambition and depth.
        </p>
        <p>
        Gameplay follows Samus Aran on Aether, navigating between light and dark dimensions to restore balance to the planet and prevent the Luminoth from being eradicated by the evil Ing. Players acquire abilities like the dark beam, light suit, and screw attack, enabling exploration across interconnected areas. 
        </p>
        <p>
        The first-person perspective, combined with scanning and lock-on combat, creates immersive gameplay that builds off the formula from the previous Prime. The game's atmospheric storytelling, varied enemies, and multiplayer mode add replayability, making it a standout sequel. The game would later be released in the Prime Trilogy for the Wii, including new motion controls.
