                Hello! My name is Jordan DiPasquale.
                I created this website to provide information about various classic games mostly from the late 90s and early 2000s. 
                This includes developers like id Software, Bungie, LucasArts and many others whose games I have enjoyed playing over the years.
                It is meant to be a "hub" of sorts to provide general information and links to other sites for my favorite PC and console games.
                So while the name is "Classic Old Games" it really is a resource for games in general.
                On the homepage, games are intentionally sorted by their respective release dates to provide a historical view of the developer's works.
            </p>
            <p>
                The design philosophy for this website is simple: Create a functional website about video games with minimal user tracking and an oldschool design aesthetic.
                This means that JavaScript will only be allowed in a minimal form on this website (as much as reasonable).
                Unfortunately, in regards to privacy, YouTube alternatives like Invidious are no longer working as well as I'd like since Google continues to change their algorithm in an attempt to prevent Invidious from functioning.
                Additionally, Teddit, a privacy focused Reddit alternative, no longer exists thanks to Reddit's awful API policy.
                As such, I have no choice but to link to these sites, though I will make an effort to warn the user before he clicks.
                One last mention that while most of this site was written by me several years ago, I have since redesigned it with the help of Gab AI, which you can use for yourself here: <a href="https://gab.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gab AI</a>.
                In an effort to be as transparent as possible, and to provide access for anyone to be able to modify this codebase, everything is available on GitHub here: <a href="https://github.com/jd-code76/classic-old-games" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">COG GitHub Codebase</a>.
