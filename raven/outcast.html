			<h2>Brief History of Star Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast</h2>
			<p>
			Originally released on March 26th, 2002 for Windows, Jedi Outcast is a direct sequel to Star Wars Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II. Jedi Outcast continues the story of Kyle Katarn, picking up several years after Dark Forces II. The general plot is that Kyle has given up his Jedi ways and gone back to mercenary work with his partner Jan. Through various plot twists, he ends up regaining his powers and becoming a Jedi once again.
			</p>
			<p>
			Jedi Outcast is considered to be one of the best Star Wars games ever made, with lightsaber combat that has yet to be matched nearly 20 years after release. Since the game is built on the id Tech 3 engine (the same engine that powers Quake III), many players have created maps, mods, and even new game modes. The game still retains a dedicated modding community that hosts tournament duels and multiplayer matches.
