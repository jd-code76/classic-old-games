			<h2>Brief History of Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy</h2>
			<p>
			Originally released on September 16th, 2003 for Windows, Jedi Academy is a different kind of Jedi Knight game. For the first time in the series, Kyle Katarn is not the main character. Instead, the player takes the role of Jaden Korr, which the player can customize to be either male or female. The player is also able to choose from three different lightsaber choices: single blade, dual blades, or double blade.
			</p>
			<p>
			Overall, these changes were well received by the community, although the story of Jedi Academy is arguably the weakest in the series. That said, the level design is great, allowing the player to visit classic locations like Yavin IV and Hoth.
			</p>
			<p>
			All these new changes were brought over to multiplayer as well, making Jedi Academy one of the best Star Wars multiplayer experiences ever created. Like Jedi Outcast, Jedi Academy has a dedicated community of modders and tournament duels.
