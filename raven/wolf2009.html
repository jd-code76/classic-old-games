			<h2>Brief History of Wolfenstein</h2>
			<p>
			Originally released on August 18th, 2009 for Windows, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3, Wolfenstein is a direct sequel to Return to Castle Wolfenstein. The gameplay is similar to Quake 4 and Doom 3, being built on the same engine (id Tech 4). While the game was a commercial and critical failure, there is still some fun to be had with its single player campaign.
			</p>
			<p>
			Unlike other games in the series, Wolfenstein contains a semi-open hub world, allowing the player moderate exploration. Throughout the game, the player can engage in several side quests in the hub world. These missions reward the player with extra gold, intel, and other useful items.
			</p>
			<p>
			The primary mechanic in the game is a medallion that allows the player to utilize "Veil Powers" of which there are 4 in total:
				<ol>
				<li>Veil - Enter/exit the Veil, increases movement speed, longer jumps, the ability to traverse Veil walls, etc.</li>
				<li>Mire - Slows down time.</li>
				<li>Shield - Increases damage resistance.</li>
				<li>Empower - Increases projectile damage.</li>
				</ol>
			While Bethesda owns the rights to the game, the game is not available on any digital distribution platforms and can only be obtained via an official physical copy or a pirated copy.
