			<h2>Brief History of Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers</h2>
			<p>
			Originally released on October 22nd, 2002 by EA Games, The Two Towers is an action hack and slash game developed by Stormfront Studios and Hypnos Entertainment. The game follows the events of the first two films in Peter Jackson's trilogy, blending footage from the films with gameplay.
			</p>
			<p>
			The game was praised for its faithful adaptation of the films, featuring the voices of the original cast members and cinematic cutscenes. Players could control Aragorn, Legolas, or Gimli through various levels, earning experience points to upgrade their abilities and combat skills.
			</p>
			<p>
			The Two Towers was a commercial success, selling over 4 million copies and receiving positive reviews for its combat system, presentation, and faithfulness to the source material. It set the standard for movie-licensed games of its era. Unfortunately, Stormfront Studios was not able to maintain a good financial position with their other licensed games and as a result, they closed down on March 31st, 2008.
			</p>
			<p>
			Additionally, a GameBoy Advance version of the game was released on November 12th, 2002, also published by EA Games but developed by Griptonite Games. This version of the game was very different to its console counterparts, taking on an isometrioc view and playing more like a traditional action RPG like Diablo. It received good reviews and is quite a unique game in its own right, considered one of the better movie tie-in games released for the system.
