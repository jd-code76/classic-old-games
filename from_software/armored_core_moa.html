			<h2>Brief History of Armored Core: Master of Arena</h2>
			<p>
			Originally released on February 4, 1999, for the PlayStation, Armored Core: Master of Arena is the second expansion to the original Armored Core and the final game in the first generation of the series. It is a fan favorite for enhancing the mech-action genre and the Armored Core series with its deep customization and challenging gameplay, cementing FromSoftware's reputation for complex, rewarding titles. The game greatly expanded upon the arena mode introduced in Project Phantasma, adding even more replayability and depth to an already lengthy entry.
			</p>
			<p>
			It is a cult classic among mecha and Armored Core fans alike, mainly for the expanded arena mode. Like previous games, players design their mechs by selecting from a litany of parts and missions have been improved upon by adding more story elements and cutscenes. Additionally, the game allows players to import their save game from Project Phantasma or the original Armored Core. If a player decides to import his save, he will have full access to the AC and money he had in the previous game, allowing for a much easier early game experience.
