			<h2>Brief History of Armored Core</h2>
			<p>
			Originally released on July 10, 1997, for the PlayStation, Armored Core is the first game in FromSoftware's mech-action series. It is considered a classic for pioneering the customizable mech genre, offering a unique blend of action and strategy that influenced later titles like the Souls series. Its acclaim stems from its innovative approach to mech customization and mission-based gameplay, which provided unmatched depth for its time. The gritty sci-fi setting and challenging difficulty further solidified its cult status, as the game uses a tank control scheme that was innovative but also cumbersome.
			</p>
			<p>
			Gameplay revolves around piloting Armored Cores, mechs that players customize with various parts like weapons, legs, and generators to suit their playstyle. Missions include combat, defense, and reconnaissance tasks, with earnings used to purchase upgrades or cover repair costs. The game’s steep learning curve and tactical depth require players to balance mech builds and mission strategies, making every encounter a test of skill and planning.
