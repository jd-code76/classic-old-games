			<h2>Brief History of Armored Core: Project Phantasma</h2>
			<p>
			Originally released on December 4, 1997, for the PlayStation, Armored Core: Project Phantasma is the first expansion to the original Armored Core. It is notable for introducing the arena mode, which would go on to become a staple of the series. Additionally, the campaign missions were greatly expanded from short contracts to longer, more story focused objectives, though this did result in there being far less missions than the first game.
			</p>
			<p>Gameplay centers on piloting customizable mechs (known as ACs) through various mission-based campaigns and arena battles. The game is also the first in the series to allow saves from the original game to be imported. If a player imports his save, he will retain his AC, unlocked parts, and any money he acquired in the previous game. This would also go on to become a staple series feature for each generation.
