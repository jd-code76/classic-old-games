			<h2>Brief History of Armored Core 2: Another Age</h2>
			<p>
			Originally released on August 22, 2001, for the PlayStation 2, Armored Core 2: Another Age is the only expansion to Armored Core 2 and it is the final entry in the 2nd generation of the Armored Core franchise. It is an infamous entry in the series for featuring over 100 missions, making it one of the longest entries in the series at the time. It also refined some of the mechanics and further expanded multiplayer options, even including an online component utilizing the i-link cable, though this was exclusive to the Japanese version.

			Just like AC2, gameplay focuses on piloting highly customizable ACs through a variety of missions, including combat, escort, and territorial defense. Players can fine-tune their AC with hundreds of parts, tailoring builds for speed, durability, or firepower. The game also allows the palyer to save up to three separate ACs at once, allowing for easier switching between missions. Like every other game in the franchise, Another Age emphasizes resource management, as mission rewards are used for upgrades and repairs.
