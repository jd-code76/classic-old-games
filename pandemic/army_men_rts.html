			<h2>Brief History of Army Men: RTS</h2>
			<p>
			Originally released on March 26th, 2002 for Windows and PS2, Army Men: RTS takes the classic RTT gameplay of the Army Men series and converts it to a real-time-strategy formula. Like most RTS games, Army Men: RTS requires the player to gather resources, build structures, and create units to complete various missions. Since the game was also released for consoles, careful attention was provided to ensure the control scheme and menus were highly functional to use with a controller.
			</p>
			<p>
			In terms of gameplay, there are two factions: green and tan. Each faction has the same units and the campaign follows the story of the Green Army and their mission to eliminate crazed turncoat, one Colonel Blintz.
			</p>
			<p>
			The console versions of the game features a 15 level singleplayer campaign with an additional 16 missions (8 special operations and 8 great battles). The PC version of the game includes the same 15 level campaign in addition to an 8-player multiplayer mode, although since the death of GameSpy, the only way to play online is via direct connection or simulated LAN.
