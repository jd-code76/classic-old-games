			<h2>Brief History of Star Wars: Battlefront</h2>
			<p>
			Originally released in Europe on October 31st, 2005 (NA release was the next day), Star Wars: Battlefront II improved on the first game in almost every way. The largest improvements where the addition of playable Hero characters, space battles, 64 player online multiplayer, and four player splitscreen, as well as a more fleshed out story mode that focuses on the 501st just before Order 66.
			</p>
			<p>
			Battlefront II was released to coincide with Episode III: Revenge of the Sith. As such, the game received a lot of hype for portraying locations from Episode III like Utapau and Mustafar, as well as allowing the player to play as "Hero" characters (Jedi, Sith, bounty hunters, and more). Gameplay-wise, Battlefront II includes all the same modes as the first game, but greatly expands on each of them. Many new modes were created as well, like Hero Assault and 1 or 2 flag variants of CTF.
			</p>
			<p>
			Battlefront II maintains a dedicated playerbase and modding community, with one such mod porting all the maps from the first game into BF2 making it the definitive Battlefront game. Additionally, like the first game, online multiplayer for the PC version is playable via Steam/GOG as well as private servers.
