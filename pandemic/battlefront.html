			<h2>Brief History of Star Wars: Battlefront</h2>
			<p>
			Originally released on September 21st, 2004 for Windows, PS2, and Xbox, Star Wars: Battlefront is one of the best selling Star Wars games of all time. The game features many classic locations from the entire Star Wars franchise (with the exception of Episode III since it released a year later) and allows players to play as one of four factions: Galactic Republic, Confederacy of Independent Systems (CIS), the Rebel Alliance, or the Galactic Empire.
			</p>
			<p>
			In terms of gameplay, Battlefront contains three game modes:
				<ol>
				<li>Campaign - Story mode that contains re-enactments of movie scenarios as well as unique ones</li>
				<li>Galactic Conquest - A pseudo board game mode where the objective is to gain control of the galaxy</li>
				<li>Instant Action - Allows the player to pick from a list of locations and factions to jump right in and play</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
			<p>
			The PC version of Battlefront also includes a 32-player online multiplayer suite. This was originally played using GameSpy, but since GameSpy is no longer available, private servers and the official Steam/GOG releases are the only ways to reliably play the game online today. The console versions support two player split-screen multiplayer.
