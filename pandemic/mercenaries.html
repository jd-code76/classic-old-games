			<h2>Brief History of Mercenaries: Playground of Destruction</h2>
			<p>
			Originally released on January 11th, 2005 for PS2 and Xbox, Mercenaries is an open world action-adventure game. Each of the three characters has different abilities, allowing the player to choose a play style that best suits his needs:
				<ol>
				<li>Chris Jacobs: Former Delta Force operator that understands Korean and can take more damage than the other mercs.</li>
				<li>Mattias Nilsson: Former Swedish Navy artillery officer that understands Russian and can move faster than the other mercs.</li>
				<li>Jennifer Mui: Former MI6 agent that understands Chinese and does not alert enemies as easily as the other mercs.</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
			<p>
			Gameplay-wise, the player is dropped into the game world and left free to roam around completing missions, collecting items, or wreaking havoc. The game also employs a faction system where the player's actions can affect the disposition of each faction towards the player. If the player's reputation with a faction is too low, he will be unable to complete missions for that faction until he bribes that factions HQ guard.
			</p>
			<p>
			The game employs a card theme where the goal is to eliminate the "Ace of Spades". In order to achieve this goal, the player must complete each "suit" by verifying and completing 13 contracts, totaling 52 (a deck of cards). The game contains several endings, however, the canon ending is revealed in the sequel.
