			<h2>Brief History of Destroy All Humans!</h2>
			<p>
			Originally released on June 21st, 2005 for PS2 and Xbox, Destroy All Humans is an action-adventure game set in fictional locations within the US. Each location acts as a "hub" that allows the player to freely roam and destroy the environment. The general plot involves the player (an alien named Crypto) is sent to rescue another alien from US Army custody.
			</p>
			<p>
			Gameplay-wise, Destroy All Humans allows the player to explore each area utilizing many different weapons and abilities. For example, the player can utilize telekinesis to pick up NPCs and objects as well as a psychokinetic ability to imitate nearby human appearances. Additionally, the player can also use Crypto's flying saucer to rain death and destruction upon the citizens of each area.
			</p>
			<p>
			A remastered version of the game was released in 2020 for eighth generation consoles and PC. This version includes improved graphics, resolution, and controls as well as additional content that was cut from the original game.
