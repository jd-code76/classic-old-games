			<h2>Brief History of Destroy All Humans! 2</h2>
			<p>
			Originally released on October 17th, 2006 for PS2 and Xbox, Destroy All Humans 2 picks up 10 years after the first. Crypto-137 (the clone protagonist from the first game) is deceased and Crypto-138 takes his place as the new player character.
			</p>
			<p>
			Like the first game, Destroy All Humans 2 contains similar gameplay and plot elements. The player has access to new abilities and weapons, including The Dislocator (shoots discs that levitate targets) and body-snatching (allowing the player to disguise himself as humans). A co-op mode was also added, allowing two players to play the story mode and engage in free roam minigames.
			</p>
			<p>
			Many players state that the game is superior to its predecessor for its many new features and mechanics. In 2021, a remaster of the game was announced and is expected to release on ninth generation consoles and PC.
