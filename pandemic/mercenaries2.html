			<h2>Brief History of Mercenaries 2: World in Flames</h2>
			<p>
			Originally released on August 31st, 2008 for PS2, PS3, and Xbox 360 (with a PC release a few days later), Mercenaries 2 takes many aspects and mechanics from the first game, while taking place in a new location in Venezuela. In contrast to the first games dark tone, Mercenaries 2 was intentionally set in Venezuela to illicit a more vibrant tone. The game includes all three playable characters from the first game plus two more mercenaries for a total of five playable characters.
			</p>
			<p>
			Mercenaries 2 had an interesting marketing strategy and was also known for having its release date changed several times over the course of its three year development. In addition, the game received heavy criticism by the Venezuelan government which assumed that the US government was trying to build support for an actual invasion of the country. This led to the following statement being added on the game's website: "Pandemic Studios is in the business of entertainment. It has not been contacted by a U.S. government agency concerning the development of Mercenaries 2. All persons, storylines and events are purely fictional and bear no relation to real events. As with any number of games, movies and books, the decision to choose interesting events and locations is purely designed to tell a compelling story, as well as provide a fun and rich experience for the gamer."
			</p>
			<p>
			The game was fairly well received by fans and, unlike the first game, Mercenaries 2 was also released for PC (with the exception of a couple DLC packs). One new feature was the ability to play the game in co-op mode. The co-op mode allows two players to roam together, however both players are required to be within a certain range of each other in addition to other limitations.
