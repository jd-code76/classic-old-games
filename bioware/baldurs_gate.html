        <h2>Brief History of Baldur's Gate</h2>
        <p>
        Originally released on December 21st, 1998 for Windows, Baldur's Gate was BioWare's first RPG and only their second game. It was also the first game created using the Infinity Engine which would go on to be used for many other classic CRPGs. Additionally, the game received an expansion titled Tales of the Sword Coast that was released on April 30th, 1999 which was well received and greatly expanded the game, essentially being a game in its own right. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Being a party-based RPG that uses the Advanced D&D 2nd edition rules, Baldur's Gate allows the player to create his own character and background. Taking place on the Sword Coast, iron resources have become scarce and bandits roam the country. Weapons and tools are weakened, making it difficult to defend against even the most basic of threats. The player is tasked with leaving the town of Candlekeep with a friendly mage to set off on his adventure proper.
        </p>
        <p>
        Gameplay in Baldur's Gate is fairly straightforward. The player controls a party of characters that he can customize to a certain degree. Each character has his own level and skills. Using these party members and skills, the player has a great degree of freedom to complete quests and explore at his own pace.
        </p>
        <p>
        Baldur's Gate is widely considered to be one of the greatest RPGs of all time, largely due to the game's story, player freedom, and immense replayability. The Infinity Engine also allows players to create mods for the game further increasing it's longevity. This legacy has cemented BG in gaming history as a pivotal title for video games and since it's release, RPGs have been forever changed.
