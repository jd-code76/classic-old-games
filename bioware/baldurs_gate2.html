        <h2>Brief History of Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn</h2>
        <p>
        Originally released on September 24th, 2000 for Windows, Baldur's Gate II took the winning formula of BG1 and greatly expanded on it. Again taking place in the Forgotten Realms setting, BG2 picks up after the events of BG1, starting with the player and his party being taken captive. Upon awakening in a cage, the player and party eventually escape and begin their new adventure. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Like BG1, an expansion titled Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal was released on June 21st, 2001. Throne of Bhaal was very well received, offering many more hours of story and replayability.
        </p>
        <p>
        Additionally, BG2 features a multiplayer mode where up to 6 players can party up and play through the game together, virtually simulating a true D&D campaign. In this mode, only one player controls the protagonist, but the story and gameplay remains the same.
        </p>
