        <h2>Brief History of Dragon Age: Origins</h2>
        <p>
        Originally released on November 3rd, 2009 for Windows, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3, Dragon Age: Origins was BioWare's attempt at a spiritual successor to Baldur's Gate and Neverwinter Nights. The story of the game takes place in a fantasy world filled with war, magic, and typical BioWare romance. The world and writing were heavily inspired by Tolkien's Lord of the Rings and Martin's Game of Thrones. As such, the game features magic, medieval settings, and of course, dragons.
        </p>
        <p>
        The general plot revolves around six origin stories that the player can choose from. These stories are determined initially by the player's chosen race and class but as the game progresses, various choices are presented to the play, allowing him to mold his character and the world as he sees fit.

        <p>
        Gameplay takes place from a third-person perspective, however, combat can be performed from an isometric perspective as well, allowing greater visibility and control. The isometric mode plays similar to a typical strategy game, allowing the player to issue commands to his party. Being D&D inspired, the game features many of the same status effects and dice rolling combat BioWare developed in their previous works, so much of the combat is determined largely by the player's stats, his party, and enemy NPCs.
        </p>
        <p>
        Overall, the game was a huge success for BioWare, giving them yet another classic series. It's sequel, Dragon Age II, would release about two years later to mixed reception due to many changes in the areas of combat, storytelling, and role-playing, disappointing many fans of DAO.
