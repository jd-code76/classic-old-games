			<h2>Brief History of Neverwinter Nights</h2>
			<p>
			Originally released on June 18th, 2002 for Windows, Neverwinter Nights was based on Neverwinter Nights (1991), which was the first MMORPG to display graphics. Set in the Forgotten Realms campaign and based on 3rd Edition D&D rules, NWN was BioWare's first game to use the Aurora engine, allowing for, at the time, quite realistic graphics and animation. Other significant features included a robust multiplayer and module suite which has allowed players to create their own MMO-like experiences via private servers. Additionally, the game received two expansions, Shadows of Undrentide (June 21st, 2003) and Hordes of the Underdark (December 2nd, 2003) as well as several premium modules which focused on individual storylines instead of an overarching plot..
			</p>
			<p>
			Neverwinter Nights is a party-based RPG like BioWare's other titles. However, being fully 3D, the player can freely zoom and move the camera in virtually any angle. Like Baldur's Gate, the game begins by letting the player fully customize his character, background, class, and stats. The main plot of the game revolves around the player being sent on a quest to retrieve four creatures known as the Waterdhavian Creatures. The city of Neverwinter is experiencing a deadly plague known as the Wailing Death. The Waterdhavian Creatures are sought after as they are rumored to be needed in order to create a cure for the deadly disease.
			</p>
			<p>
			As far as gameplay is concerned, Neverwinter Nights is played from a top-down perspective similar to Baldur's Gate. The game is semi-turn-based and can be paused to allow the player time to think. Since the game utilizes D&D 3E rules, each action is based on the player's skills and a dice roll versus the enemy he is taking action against.
			</p>
			<p>
			Neverwinter Nights has received numerous mods and support from players well after release, with some continuing to play even today. While the game was both a critical and commercial success for BioWare, they have not indicated any plans to return to the franchise any time soon.
