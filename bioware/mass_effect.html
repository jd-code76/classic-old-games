			<h2>Brief History of Mass Effect</h2>
			<p>
			Originally released on November 20th, 2007 for the Xbox 360, Mass Effect was BioWare's attempt to create their own franchise based on the success of KotOR. Like KotOR, ME is an RPG that allows the player to make his own choices throughout the game. Unlike KotOR, however, ME is a 3rd-person shooter instead of a D&D based RPG (although the game does keep the three person party).
			</p>
			<p>
			The story of Mass Effect follows Commander Shepard who the player can customize (to a certain degree) on his quest to eliminate the mysterious Reapers from the galaxy. Throughout the game, the player will travel to multiple planets in several galaxies, completing quests, recruiting companions, and getting better gear. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Mass Effect would go on to become one of the most highly appreciated franchises in sci-fi history, sometimes being referred to as the "Star Wars of video games". While ME has its flaws, the game has much replayability and several branching paths. Additionally, the game garnered controversy for its romance elements, with many news outlets calling it "pornographic". 
			</p>
			<p>
			Although the game was initially an Xbox 360 exclusive, the PC release has seen many mods that drastically improve the game. As a whole, the game was a huge critical and commercial success for BioWare and continued their legacy of creating fully realized RPGs with captivating stories.
