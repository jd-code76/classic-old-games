			<h2>Brief History of Marathon</h2>
			<p>
			Originally released on December 21st, 1994 for the Apple Macintosh, Marathon is the first game in the Marathon Trilogy. The game is notable for being one of the earliest FPS games to incorporate an intricate story into the gameplay. It is also known as the Mac's answer to Doom since the two games share many of the same gameplay systems. However, in terms of features, Marathon has a superior engine that allows the player to look up and down and a crude form of "rooms over rooms" (something that a lot of early FPS games struggled with).
			</p>
			<p>
			Bungie released the source code of the Marathon games and for a while was even distributing them as freeware. This helped to create the open source Aleph One engine that can be used to play the entire Trilogy on modern systems. Also of note is that the Halo games took significant inspiration from Marathon. This is most noticeable with things like the rocket launcher, enemies ranked by color, and some other minor references.
