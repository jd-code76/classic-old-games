			<h2>Brief History of Myth II: Soulblighter</h2>
			<p>
			Originally released on December 28th, 1998 for Windows and Mac OS, Myth II greatly improved on the formula established by the first game. Bungie greatly expanded the campaign, multiplayer, and modding capabilities as well as adding other quality of life features to the game's UI. The story picks up sixty years after TFL and tells the story of Soulblighter, one of the Fallen Lords. The game begins with Alric, one of the Nine sorcerers, waking to a red-eyed crow after having a nightmare recalling his experience in the Great War.
			</p>
			<p>
			To this day, there is still a small but highly dedicated community that creates mods, maintains the game, and runs multiplayer tournaments. Upon the initial release of the game, a Japanese translator discovered a bug in the Windows version of the game. If a user installed the game in his root directory and then later uninstalled the game, most of the contents of his hard drive would also be subsequently deleted. This bug prompted Bungie to recall nearly 200,000 copies of the game, a move that cost $800,000 and almost bankrupt the company.
