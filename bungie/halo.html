			<h2>Brief History of Halo: Combat Evolved</h2>
			<p>
			Originally released on November 15th, 2001 for the original Xbox, Halo: CE is regarded as one of the most important video games of all time. It established many groundbreaking features that games still employ today. These features include a two weapon limit, enhanced console controls and aim-assist, unique NPC AI, and a trio of combat mechanics (shooting, melee, and grenades) each available at the press of a button.
			</p>
			<p>
			Halo is also well-known for it's intriguing sci-fi plot and it's fantastic multiplayer. The game was originally going to include Xbox Live multiplayer, but in order to have the game be released as a launch title, online multiplayer was ultimately left out of the original Xbox release. Some players also used Halo to create videos known as "machinima" films. The most popular Halo machinima, and arguably the most popular machinima in general, is Red vs. Blue, created by Rooster Teeth.
			</p>
			<p>
			Online multiplayer was officially added to the 2003 Gearbox PC port which 343 Industries used to build the MCC port. Unfortunately for players, the Gearbox port is known to have many technical issues and multiplayer lag, although 343 has fixed many of these issues in the MCC release. One good thing that came from the Gearbox port was Halo: Custom Edition. This is a free download for players who own Halo: CE on PC and allows modders and mappers to add, modify, and create new maps, modes, and more.
			</p>
			<p>
			Another interesting fact about Halo: CE is that Bungie originally designed it as an RTS similar to their earlier Myth titles. A proper Halo RTS would not be released until Ensemble Studios released Halo Wars in 2009. A remastered version of the game titled "Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary was released in 2011 to celebrate the 10 year anniversary of Halo. It includes new graphics and audio and allows the player to swap between these in real time with the press of a button.
