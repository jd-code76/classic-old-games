			<h2>Brief History of Oni</h2>
			<p>
			Originally released on January 28th, 2001 for Windows, Oni is the only game ever released by Bungie West. Oni combines third-person shooting with action based martial arts combat similar to what is found in 2D fighting games. The main campaign takes place in the year 2032 and depicts a dystopian world where the Earth is highly polluted and a one-world government called the World Coalition Government controls everything. The main character, Konoko, is sent on a mission by the Technological Crimes Task Force (TCTF) to investigate a crime scene involving a newly formed terrorist group.
			</p>
			<p>
			Oni is heavily influenced by the movie Ghost in the Shell so much that Konoko was originally supposed to be a cyborg. The game implements a frame interpolation technique that allows for very smooth animation, making the martial arts moves look cinematic and realistic. The game was supposed to have a multiplayer mode, but it was cut before release due to time constraints. While the game did not sell very well, it retains a dedicated modding community.
