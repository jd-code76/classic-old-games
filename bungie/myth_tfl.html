			<h2>Brief History of Myth: The Fallen Lords</h2>
			<p>
			Released on November 7th, 1997 for Windows and Mac OS, Myth is a real time tactics (RTT) game set in a mythical fantasy world. The story encompasses several missions where the forces of "The Light" and "The Dark" are at war. A group of elite sorcerers known as "The Nine" lead the Legion (Light) into battle against Balor (Dark). Only five are officially named.
			</p>
			<p>
			Myth was a notable game in the RTT genre, introducing a detailed physics engine and removing the RTS base-building an resource gathering requirements. Instead, the player starts each level with a certain number of forces (some levels provide reinforcements) and the player must work with what he has available. The game has several units such as archers, knights, and dwarves, each with their own strengths and weaknesses.
