			<h2>Brief History of Halo: Reach</h2>
			<p>
			Originally released on September 14th, 2010 for the Xbox 360, Halo: Reach was Bungie's last Halo game. Reach combined nearly every aspect of earlier titles and greatly improved on certain aspects (although dual-wielding was removed). Firefight received a major upgrade, allowing players to customize the game mode to their liking and multiplayer was greatly expanded on with cosmetic upgrades that the player could buy using credits earned by simply playing the game.
			</p>
			<p>
			Reach added several other features like assassinations and commendations for the first time in the franchise. While commendations have not returned in future titles, assassinations have been a part of every major Halo game since Reach.
